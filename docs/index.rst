**The Geth fork to end all Forks.**

PluGeth is a fork of the Go Ethereum Client, `Geth`_, that implements a plugin architecture allowing developers to extend Geth's capabilities in a number of different ways using plugins rather than having to create additional new forks. 

PluGeth aims to provide a secure and versitile tool for users running their own Geth nodes, developers running custom Geth nodes, or projects using Geth as a basis for other chains.

All dependencies and updates are handled by the PluGeth project, and so, PluGeth enables developers to focus on their projects without having to maintian upstream code.
