**The Geth fork to end all Forks.**

PluGeth is a fork of the Go Ethereum Client, `Geth`_, implementing the Golang plugin architecture allowing developers to adapt and extend Geth's capabilities using plugins rather than having to create additional new forks. 

The PluGeth project aims to provide a secure and versitile tool for anyone who needs to run a Geth (or Geth-derived) node client that supports features beyond those offered by Gethâ€™s vanilla EVM. 

All dependencies and updates are handled by the PluGeth project, and so, PluGeth enables developers to focus on their projects without having to maintian upstream code.
