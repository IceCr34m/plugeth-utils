System Requirements
===================

If compiling from source code Plugeth requires that the user have `Go`_ version 1.17 or later. 

Our provided release binaries require `Glibc`_ 2.29. 

.. note:: System requirements vary depending on the network being run. For detailed requirements Refer to `Geth`_ documentation.

.. warning:: PluGeth relies on Golang's Plugin implementation, which is only supported on Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS. Windows support is unlikely to be added in the foreseeable future.
